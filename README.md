MapReduce-Coursework
====================

This repository holds the projects we did in Hadoop &amp; MapReduce (95-869) of CMU. 

We hope the ideas in these projects can give some insights.

Notice that we took advantage of 
  1. A stemmer class from the Internet in project 1;
  2. A parser class and an WholeFileInputFormat class from the sample code in Hadoop: The Definitive Guide, in project 2 and project 4, respectively; and
  3. DynamicLMClassifier class from LingPipe.

Project 3 is shared under AGPL license due to the license under which LingPipe is pushlished. Considered each project could work seperately, the license of rest of the projects are undecided yet.
